A game-changing move. White uses his own piece to cause real concern with
Black's bottom-edge connection, forcing black to respond &mdash; while also
using the neutral piece to turn the bridge connection at the top insecure.

One immediate conclusion from this is that in Nex, unlike in Hex, bridges need
to be monitored closely. In Hex, they can still be intruded on, but in Nex, an
intrusion can happen slowly and in several different ways. This needs more
analysis.

Black responds by pushing through one of the white bridges to the edge. Even
here, White could defend immediately by converting the gray stone just placed,
blocking the offense towards the edge.

Instead, White makes good on the bridge intrusion. Black now has no viable
connection to the top edge.

This decisively ends the game. Black could intrude with both pieces into the
remaining bridge, but White would just convert the neutral piece and complete
the white chain.
